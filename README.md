http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Probability/LightBulbs.shtml

Python implementation of solving 100 prisoners and a lightbulb riddle by using counting prisoner and normal prisoners

Details:

All prisoners except the counting prisoner only turn on the light if both criteria are met:
a) the light is off
b) they have not turned on the light before

Counter prisoner keeps track of times entered room where light is on, counter will turn off the light.
Counter will assert everyone has been in the room after he counts 99 times where the light bulb is on.
